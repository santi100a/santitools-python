This repo contains a set of Python tools and APIs that I use for personal projects.

These utilities are:

- **Filesystem (`filesystem.py`):** A collection of tools for working with files, synchronously or using co-routines.
- **Colors (`colors.py`):** It provides 3 ways to colorize your text with ANSI escape sequences: using an already-built dictionary, a function or a special colorizer object.
- **Math (`math.py`):** A set of math functions (for randomness mostly) and highly accurate math constants.
- **Time (`time.py`):** A time API that's very similar to JavaScript's `Date` object.
- **Screen Clear (`__init__.py`):** A function to easily clear the screen, by using 1 of 2 methods: the `os` module's `system` function or an ANSI escape sequence.
- **Bisect (`__init__.py`):** A binary-search algorithm as a function. It's useful for finding a value in a sorted list, with a logarithmic time complexity.

It so happens I just packaged this project, so now you can install it with the command
`pip install santitools`. Try it out!

**WARNING: The math randomness functions are just as safe as the built-in `random` module. They are just a JavaScript-like wrapper.*
